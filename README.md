### Goal

This project aims to build a service to manage email subscription for a business or a blog.

### User Stories

- As a blog visitor, I want to subscribe to the newsletter, so that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog.
- As a blog author, I want to send an email to all my subscribers, so that I can notify them when new content is published.

### Out of scope

- Unsubscribe
- Manage multiple newsletters
- Segment subscribers in multiple audiences
- track opening and click rates

### Decisions

- Use Rust for the project backend because I love Rust :).
